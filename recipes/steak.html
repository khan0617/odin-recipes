    <p>This is a wonderful steak dish that was prepared for me when I lived in Argentina. This Argentinean 
        steak dish is quite popular in various restaurants around Buenos Aires.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup red wine</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>4 New York strip steaks, cut 1-inch thick</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the red wine, salt and rosemary in a small bowl. Let stand at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Heat a large griddle or cast-iron skillet over high heat. Place the steaks on the hot pan, and cook for about 8 minutes per side, or to desired degree of doneness. The internal temperature should be at least 145 degrees F (62 degrees C) for medium rare. Pour in the wine mixture, and allow it to boil for a minute. Serve steaks with sauce on a deep platter.</li>
    </ol>
